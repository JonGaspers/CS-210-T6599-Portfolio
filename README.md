CS-210-T6599 Jonathon Gaspers Portfolio Submission
This project was to create a zoo system that allows users to add and remove animals from the zoo system, along with saving and load the animals to/from a file. I feel I did well with how the program loads the animals from a file into the vector on a per-line basis from the zoodata.txt file. I could enhance the code by allowing the user to search for specific animals based on their tracking ID number using a binary search algorithm to keep user wait time at a low. I found creating a vector of objects a little challenging, especially when loading information from a file and creating objects to add to the vector. I think I found a good method of overcoming this issue by using loops to collect the necessary data then creating the object with that data then finally adding it to the vector. 

A skill from this project that is particularly transferable is manipulating vectors and loading/saving information to a file. This could be helpful in future courses and work by allowing me to save data in a manageable data structure and being able to save that data structure to a file that could later be loaded into the program to continue where the user left off is beneficial for future projects. I made this program readable by adding in-line comments that explain the code.
